  <h3 class="w3-center">Image Segmentation</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Can machines see the world around us?</p>
    <p class="w3-center w3-large">Until recently no one was sure exactly if it were possible to have a computer understand its surroundings. 
	As the field of computer science and artificial intelligence grew so did the unbelievable capabilities of computers themselves. 
	One of these new advancements is computer vision. This field is rapidly optimizing the world around us overnight and has further 
	applications beyond the scope of our current knowledge. From simple image processing to self driving cars, a whole new world is emerging. 
	In this tutorial the basics of computer vision will be explained through the use of Image Segmentation.</p>
	
	</br>
    <p class="w3-center w3-large"><p class="w3-center w3-large">So what exactly is Image Segmentation?</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">

    <p class="w3-center w3-large">To understand what image segmentation is, a natural place to start is with object detection. 
	Object detection is a way of classifying images by what they consist of. A program developed for this purpose can generally detect the 
	area of a feature within an image without any consideration of the exact attributes of the feature. 
	Knowing an image has a certain object within it has limited uses and neglects to include the shape of the object. 
	To gain more information about the pictures one must use Image Segmentation. As seen in the pictures above, 
	image segmentation provides the exact pixel location of the object giving the user a lot of important and applicable information 
	that has proven to have a massive impact. (See Below).</p>

      <p>Through your windshield a typical view may consist of street lamps, traffic lights, other cars, pedestrians, barriers and 
	  the sidewalk. The difference between all of these items is crucial, and an autonomous vehicle needs to understand them with a 
	  very high accuracy. These segmentations help create an understanding of the world around the vehicle.

      <p>Early detection of cancerous cells is vital in saving someone's life. In these life or death situations, humans may not be 
	  qualified to look through every image of cells and make an accurate estimate of the state of a disease. By using Image 
	  Segmentation on medical images, diseases may be found at early stages more accurately.

      <p>Images of astronomical objects are usually taken with electronic detectors such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device). These 
	  images are nearly always grayscale, but contain some color information. An astronomical image may be taken through a color 
	  filter based on the data relevant to wavelengths and distance. This challenging task has been exponentially streamlined by 
	  Image Segmentation.</p>

   </a>
   
   <p class="w3-center w3-large" style= "position:relative; top:-100px;">Provided above are two instrumental resources that describe 
   the foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks.These networks essentially convert a picture into a probability. What that means is, with the input of an image, 
   the computer starts to break it down into sections. These sections all represent a probability of these pixels containing 
   some feature. For example, in the segmented picture from above, the “blank” was at one point broken into pieces where if 
   a “blank.feature” was in a section, then it would have a very high probability of being part of the whole “blank”, 
   thus it would be colored accordingly. Initially, the network does not know the difference between these features nor what 
   probability to associate the pixels with. To accomplish this, the model must be trained. By feeding the program example 
   data (in this case pictures that already have the correct segmentations), the model can be tested and can learn. On the 
   first pass the model can not differentiate between any of the characteristics of a photo. This data will then be measured 
   in accuracy to determine how much the computer will have to adjust to create a more accurate model. After several iterations 
   (called epochs) the model will continuously improve and become more and more accurate. If this is still confusing, don’t 
   worry it is very dense material but the commented code below will help draw out every point made in the video, paper, 
   and our analysis of each.</p>
