This is a website that helps teach image segmenation with fully convolutional networks. Included in the website is a way to upload your own images and get back segmentations.

In order to run our program on your machine, you will need to install following packages: 
  
  flask
  
  pytorch
  
  torchvision
  
  numpy
  
  matplotlib
  
  PIL
  
  
The model files must be ran to save saveModel.pth and segSaveModel.pth. Move these files after running into the flask directory.
  
To run our program, type in terminal: flask run
